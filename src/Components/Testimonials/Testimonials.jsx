                In my experience all the teachers are very supportive and
                friendly and the placement process has been very smooth
                throughout. I would always be very grateful for the lifelong
                connections I made

                My favorite part of studying at Tribhuvan University is having
                the opportunity to learn from such a diverse range of subjects.
                From Mathematics to History, Philosophy to Environment Science,
                each class provides an in depth look into a completely new
                world.

                I learnt so much about myself during this time that itâ€™s hard to
                put into words. But what I can say is that I feel like I have
                becomeI have studied here before and it was amazing.

                In my opinion,the best course I have taken so far has been
                CSE4025 - Data Structures and Algorithms. It was not only I love
                how Tribhuvan university makes you work.
